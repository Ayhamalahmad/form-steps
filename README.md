## Introduction

Form Steps is a web page that demonstrates a multi-step form with smooth navigation and visual indicators to guide users through the form-filling process. The form allows users to progress forward or backward, one step at a time, simplifying the form-filling experience and reducing complexity.

## Features

- Multi-step Form: The form is divided into multiple steps to make the form-filling process more user-friendly and manageable.
- Step Indicator: The current step is visually indicated, providing users with a clear understanding of their progress within the form.
- Step Navigation: Users can easily navigate between steps using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- Disabled Buttons: The "Previous" and "Next" buttons are appropriately disabled when they are not applicable (e.g., at the first or last step).
- Smooth Transitions: Form progress and step navigation use smooth transitions to enhance the user experience.
